# Mercari
Product pricing at scale is a difficult task, considering just how many products are sold online. Clothing has strong seasonal pricing trends and is heavily influenced by brand names, while electronics have fluctuating prices based on product specs. Through this project, I want to build an algorithm which can suggests product prices for online retailers.

My client, Mercari, is one of Japan’s biggest online shopping sites. In order to improve better serve their customers, Mercari wants to offer price suggestion to their sellers when they are posting a new product for sale on their site. Based on my prediction, Mercari would be able to:

-Identify the product detail such as category, brand and type.

-Offer a price suggestion based on products’ detail.

-Modify the product price before selling on the Mercari marketplace.
